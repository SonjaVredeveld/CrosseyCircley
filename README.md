# CrosseyCircley
Browser-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, made with Node.js / Express / EJS

Part of hacktoberfest 2021! 

Installation:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- git clone https://github.com/linkret/CrosseyCircley.git
- cd CrosseyCircley
- npm install
- node index.js
- Connect to the game on http://localhost:8000 from your browser.

If you want to test it and play against yourself, open the game in two tabs. Create a new game from one tab, and join that tab from the other tab.

Some pictures:

The game page, game.ejs. Click on cells to mark them:

The game is multiplayer, and players take turns clicking on cells, until someone wins. 

Main page, index.ejs. Choose a game to join, or create a new one:

Originally implemented in two hours for fun, and as practice. I have almost zero web-dev experience. But I want to work on this project more, and find ways to improve it until it's no longer crap-tier. 

Warm thanks to everyone that contributed so far!
