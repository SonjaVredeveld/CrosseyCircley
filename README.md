Installation:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

The game is multiplayer, and players take turns clicking on cells. When someone wins, the board turns green, and nobody can click any more cells.

Implemented in two hours, for fun, and as practice. I have almost zero web-dev experience. But I want to work on this project more, and find ways to improve it until it's no longer crap-tier. 

Thanks for visiting,
